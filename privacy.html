                <p>Effective Date: 23/01/2025</p>

                <p>VCGames ("we," "us," or "our") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it.
                    This Privacy Policy outlines our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of
                    information when you use our website, games, or services, including the [Your App Name] app
                    available on the Google Play Store.</p>

                <p>1. Information We Do Not Collect</p>

                <p>We do not collect, store, or process any personal or non-personal data from our users. This means:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>We do not collect personal information such as your name, email address, or contact details.</li>
                    <li>We do not track or store information about your device, IP address, location, or usage.</li>
                    <li>We do not use cookies, analytics tools, or third-party trackers.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>2. Third-Party Services</p>

                <p>Although we do not collect any data, our games or website may include links to third-party services
                    (such as external websites or app stores). These third-party services may collect data in accordance
                    with their own privacy policies, and we recommend reviewing those policies before interacting with
                    them.</p>

                <p>3. Children’s Privacy</p>

                <p>We comply with laws regarding the protection of children’s privacy, such as the Children’s Online
                    Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). Our games and website are designed for general audiences and do not
                    knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13 (or under 16 in certain
                    regions). If you believe a child has provided personal information, please contact us so we can
                    address the issue.</p>

                <p>4. Updates to This Privacy Policy</p>

                <p>We may update this policy from time to time. If changes are made, the "Effective Date" at the top
                    will reflect the latest revision. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.</p>
